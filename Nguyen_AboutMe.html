          <p>An entrepreneur usually starts off from making $10,400 and slowly 
          grows their salary up to $129,200. Hello, my name is TinhPhong, and I 
          attend Dublin High School. After graduating from college, I wish to become a 
          successful entrepreneur that makes more than $500,000 a year. My plan 
          for reaching this goal is simple. I will first graduate from high school 
          and attempt to average higher than a 4.0 GPA. When I get into college, I 
          will take the classes that I will need to graduate, and maybe even take 
          extra classes about creating your own business. After graduating college, I 
          will create multiple online businesses where I buy, sell, and fix 
          computer parts. This is my dream job because as an entrepreneur, you 
          have the potential to make a lot of money as well as learn a lot of new               
          skills.  
          </p>
      
          <p>My strengths that relate to this career are ambition and independence. 
          In all tests, assignments, and projects, I always am determined to get the 
          highest score possible, and when I don't get the score that I want, I study
          and work harder to get my desired score. My ambition will help me achieve 
          this goal because when I have a desire for this career, I will work harder 
          and harder until I get it. I am extremely independent because I do a lot of 
          things for myself, from doing the laundry, to washing the dishes, and even 
          cooking. This independence will help me achieve my goal because this skill 
          will be one of the most important skills for an entrepreneur since you will 
          make your own business. You need to know how to take care of yourself and
          do things by yourself before creating your own business.
          </p>
      
          <p>In my whole entire lifetime, I have had many accomplishments. One of them 
          is getting a GPA of 4.0 and Principal's Honor Roll from 6th to 8th grade. 
          Never getting a B makes me prideful and more ambitious to get all A's. 
          Over the summer, I also packaged food for hungry kids all over Asia and Africa
          in a non-profit organization called Kids Against Hunger. Another accomplishment
          of mine is making the Wells 8th grade basketball team. There were about 40 kids
          that tried out for the team, and I was one of the 13 people who made the team. 
          Besides making the basketball team, helping my team make the playoffs was a 
          true accomplishment as well. All of these accomplishments have taught me many 
          things. Making the basketball team taught me how effective a team could be if 
          communication was good. Better communication made better executions of plays 
          in basketball. Getting a 4.0 GPA for 3 years straight taught me that working hard 
          is worth it. Not because of the rewards you get, but because it makes you
          feel good about yourself. 
          </p>
            
          <p>I have a goal to become an entrepreneur, I have many accomplishments 
          throughout my life, and everything that I have experienced through life has
          taught me many things that make me the person I am today. My website displays 
          who I am, so check out my resume, projects, and contact me page.
