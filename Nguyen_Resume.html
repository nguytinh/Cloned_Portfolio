            Career Goal
          </h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>After graduating from college, I wish to start multiple online businesses 
              and become an entrepreneur
            </ul>

          <h4>
            Education
          </h4>
          <p>
            I attend Dublin High School in Dublin California. I am a Freshman at DHS and
            the classes that I take are CSP (Computer Science Programming), Geometry, 
            Advanced English 9, Spanish 2, Physical Education, Biology, and Health. When 
            I graduate from High School, I want to go to UC Berkeley to study Computer 
            Science or UC Davis for Business and Management.      
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Volunteer Experience
          </h4>
          <p>
            Every week on Sundays I volunteer as a team leader at Gia Dinh Phat Tu 
            Chanh Duc a Buddhist youth group. I teach peers, and I help lead and prepare
            activities for them. I have been volunteering here from August 22nd, 2017 to 
            the present day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently in the summer on September 29th, 2018, I also volunteered at a 
            non-profit organization called Kids Against Hunger. I packaged food for 2 hours
            to feed hungry kids all over Africa and Asia. After 2 hours the whole group 
            managed to pack enough food to feed 12,000 kids.  
          </p>

          <h4>
            Work Experience
          </h4>
          <p>
            From June 2nd, 2018 to August 12th, 2018 I tested hard drives and I helped 
            organize mechanical products at my family business called 4yourbusiness. I
            worked diligently for 6 hours every weekday and some weekends. This was a great
            opportunity for me to actually get work experience, help out my family 
            business, and make some money at the same time. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Skills
          </h4>
          <p>
            I am bilingual. I can speak English and Vietnamese fluently. I practice my 
            English every day at school, and every weekend, I have to take a Vietnamese 
            class. I also know how to speak Spanish, but I am not fluent. At DHS, I'm in 
            Spanish 2 and I currently have an A in that class, so I can say that I'm pretty
            good at Spanish.

          <h4>
            Academic Awards & Highlights
          </h4>
          <p>
            Throughout all of middle school, I had only 4.0's. I got 8 Principal's Honor 
            Rolls at Wells Middle School from 7th to 9th grade while being in a higher math
            class than the average student. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Extracurricular Activities
          </h4>
          <p>
            I was on the basketball team in 8th grade at Wells Middle School. Out of the 
            40 kids who tried out to make the team, I was one of the 13 kids who made it
            on the team. As well as basketball, I also play the piano. I have been playing
            piano for almost 9 years now, and I can pretty much read or play any song.
